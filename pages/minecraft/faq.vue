            joining the server is very easy! simply add the server IP address
            onto either the direct connect field, or add it on your Minecraft
            servers list.

          why use Quilt? isn&apos;t it still in beta?
        </p>
        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            the Quilt project provides a sleek and modern modding toolchain, as
            well as provides an open ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quilt is also very lightweight on system resources, meaning that
            hardware costs can be brought down by a significant amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            besides that, it's also community-driven, extremely modular, and
            stupidly powerful with a rich library of modules to write more
            compatible mods with little effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            while yes it is still in beta, the mod loader itself is very stable.
            i believe that improvement starts with you, and with your help
            testing Quilt, i can also additionally improve the project by
            contributing patches and bug fixes.

              Forge has a ton of content, but more people have been jumping to
              Fabric because of the lead developers harassing and behaving like
              10-year-olds to the community.

          </div>
          <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" class="text-sm text-gray-500">
            *cracks knuckles* time for a whole essay ranting about Forge
          </p>
          <p>
            while yes, Forge has a ton of content tailored for it, most
            developers seem to have jump ships because of the way the lead
            developer of Forge has treated over the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            i am not comfortable with the way the Forge community has treated
            users. it&apos;s a very difficult road, almost near impossible to
            even get basic concessions out the core development team that offer
            any benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            you've seen it in the past with OptiFine -- simply put, the lead
            developers no interest in supporting mods which try to patch game
            code, and instead insists on being an API that other mods can be
            built upon.
          </p>
          <p>
            there are also significant challenges in maintaining mods for the
            Forge platform as-is, and having to deal with a community that
            actively takes to discrediting people's work at any opportunity does
            not make it worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            on top of that, Forge is often very slow at porting for newer
            versions of Minecraft, as the modloader bundles a lot of unnecessary
            features into the game. this was proven by the fact that Forge for
            1.13 and 1.14 was never released, until late into 1.14.2 came out.
          </p>
          <p>
            not only is Forge slow at releasing, but it&apos;s also makes the
            game itself slow. newer versions of Forge have seem to hurt the
            game&apos;s performance more and more, and Forge itself is very
            sluggish at loading mods.
          </p>
          <p>
            at this point, even if major changes were to be made in Forge's
            management and treatment of the community, it would be too little,
            and too late. time is precious, and i'm not sure about you, but i
            would rather be supporting a community that supports and encourages
            fellow modders.

          <p>
            originally, OptiFine was a great mod offering many quality-of-life
            improvements for the player in the beginning. however, over the
            years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for
            modders.
          </p>
          <p>
            this is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and
            OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code
            while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why
            OptiFine has broken another modder's mod.
          </p>
          <p>
            it's also worth noting that natively, OptiFine doesn&apos;t support
            Fabric/Quilt.
          </p>
          <p>
            while mods like OptiFabric have attempted to make OptiFine and
            Fabric/Quilt compatible with one another, with 1.16 and some 1.15
            mods, OptiFabric has simply broken and the maintainer has refused to
            continue development.
          </p>
          <p>
            this is due to the way OptiFine changes the vanilla code in
            increasingly invasive ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            on top of that, OptiFine now gives little to no improvement over
            using the vanilla renderer. Minecraft's default rendering engine has
            significantly improved over the years, and using OptiFine simply
            doesn't make sense now, unless you're running a Minecraft version
            prior to 1.13.
          </p>
          <p>
            in the modern Minecraft era, with Fabric's community effort, modders
            have begun to create alternatives for most of OptiFine's features to
            allow players to maintain better performance, better mod
            compatibility, and better support.

        <div class="space-y-2">
          <p>
            you can't install Quilt on TLauncher, period. instead of TLauncher,
            use something like UltimMC, which has a better GUI and runs way
            faster while consuming less resources
