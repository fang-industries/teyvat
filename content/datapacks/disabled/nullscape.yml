name: Nullscape
desc: Overhauls the End's generation in a way that maintains this identity - a realm of utter desolation. Nullscape will make you feel tiny and alone in the vast expanse of the End. Also boosts the height to 384 blocks, and makes use of 1.18's features to generate incredibly varied terrain.
