## a lil' backstory

essentially, a lightning struct on our old house and we had to build a new one. this happened around a week ago, and since then, we've been building our new base for the last couple of days.

![our previous base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnxl/teyvat/master/assets/blog/images/we-moved-the-base/2022-05-29_00.04.17.png)

in the middle of building our base, Tristan found some really cool piece of terrain, that looked amazing for our base.

after some back and forth, we decided to move the base to the valley. but c'mon! our current house is around 2,000 blocks away and is absolutely huge! no way we're going to move it by hand.

that's where our secret weapon comes in, WorldEdit. our plan is to move the base to the valley we found, and then use the `//regen` command in order to regenerate the terrain we built on, erasing all sorts of terraforming and buildings placed.

it's not a part of the vanilla experience !!! ~ Evan, probably
</blockquote>

and so that's why, we ultimately decided to not tell Evan about the base move.

## "the walking base"

moving the base with WorldEdit is easy! simply obtain a WorldEdit wand, a left-click here and a right-click there, and `//cut`!

for the sheep and cows, i had to use an awful amount of leads and fly them over seas and lands. unfortunately however, about a total of 7 lives were lost. press F to pay respects to the sheep.

the pets however, required manually moving with each of the pet's owners. Bri's dogs are easy, as they follow her. for people that own cats like Ashley and Cha-Cha however, they had to manually be pushed or used leashes on.

alright then, that's all out of the way!

## the 3R -- regenerate, reuse, recycle?!

oops, the terrain now looks awful!

well, that's where the handy `//regen` WorldEdit command come in! basically what it does is that it, well, regenerates the terrain.

a left-click here, a right-click there, and run `//regen`, and the selected region will be put back into its earliest seed-generated form.

there is an exclusion however, we decided to keep the nether portal and the creeper farm.

Evan built the nether farm and it looked amazing, essentialy and the looking like that a mini nether biome has crashed into the overworld. we did however hide it, we moved the portal and the surrounding area down by 50 blocks with WorldEdit's `//move` command.

as for the creeper farm, we decided to keep it as it took a stupidly long time to build

## some extra additions

we also decided to add some extra features to our base.

added a new basement; villager trading hall; and a love garden, inspired by stampy!

we decided to make a new basement because we all figured that it's too much of a hassle to move the previous one and lining up the stairs with the new house. even if we did, i can't lie it kinda looks half-assed, so i simply decided to make a new, much more modern basement.

as for the villager trading hall, i decided that it would be too much of a hassle to carry villagers on boats, it's painfully slow and just a hassle. so i decided to make a new one, and kidnap more villagers.

i really like this new design as it has villagers on different habitats according to their professions, and it doesn't look like a depressing stone brick box.

as for the love garden, i just made it because why not? the love garden contains the names of everyone that joined the server, and the server owner.
